    "\n",
    "The dataset was collected in **October 2021** using a Python-based Scrapy script and made publicly available by **Gautham Prakash**.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”— [Apple App Store Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/apple-appstore-apps)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains detailed information about more than 1.2 million iOS applications from the Apple App Store. Each row represents a unique app, and the data spans a wide range of fields that give us a deep look into the app ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 21 columns in total, covering things like app IDs, developer details, pricing, user ratings, update history, and more. For example, we can find out when an app was released or last updated, how big the app is in bytes, what iOS version it requires, and whether itâ€™s free or paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this dataset even more interesting is that it includes both overall and current version ratings, along with review counts. This gives us a chance to compare how apps are performing over time. The presence of developer websites and profile links also allows us to look into developer-level activity and app publishing trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, itâ€™s a large and well-structured dataset that offers plenty of opportunities for meaningful analysis, especially if youâ€™re curious about how apps are built, maintained, and received by users.\n"

We observed that free apps tend to attract more users and reviews, while user ratings remain a reliable metric for gauging app quality. Although pricing had little correlation with ratings, it influenced download volume. By combining univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques, we now have a strong foundation for predictive modeling, business strategy, or deeper machine learning tasks going forward.\n"
